Project Euler
=============

This is the ever-evolving source to my solutions to Project Euler questions, currently pulled from here:

http://projecteuler.co/

A up-to-date build of these solutions is typically available here:

Released under the Boost Software License (Version 1.0).

Installation:
-------------

    git clone https://github.com/joedrago/euler.git
    cd euler
    npm install -g coffee-script
    npm install
    cake build

You can then access index.html via a web server. If you don't have a server available or this directory isn't web-accessible, you can use "cake server" to run a local one on port 9000.
